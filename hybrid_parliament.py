Hybrid Parliament Orchestrator Demo.

Demonstrates the ultimate combination of two powerful architectures:
1. The Parliament: A mixture-of-agents setup that debates abstract tasks to reach a definitive consensus roadmap.
2. The Orchestrator: Takes the finalized parliament roadmap and actually assigns/delegates sub-agents to execute it.
